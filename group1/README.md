# SUBGROUP 1 README 

First, you must ensure that you have all required packages installed by running the following commmand:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Requirements
- Python 3.11.9

## Running tests
In order to run the tests, you need to run the ```evaluation.ipynb``` Jupyter notebook. You will be able to see the results in the output cells.

## Other steps
To re-train the steps, you can run the ```train_models.py``` file. However, you will require a ```/data``` folder in the parent folder of the ```group1``` folder, that contains training and test csv files.
